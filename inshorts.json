        "article_body": "Amid sanctions by the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin wore a blue jacket made by an Italian brand, Loro Piana, priced at 1.5 million roubles (over ₹10 lakh), at a rally while justifying the Ukraine war. As per a report, in 2021, the average Russian's annual salary was 678,000 roubles, less than half the cost of Putin's jacket."
