        "article_body": "Scientists believe broccoli gas could help provide compelling evidence of life on other planets. In order to expel toxins, broccoli, like other organisms, adds one carbon and three hydrogen atoms to an unwanted chemical and turns the potential toxin into a gas that floats away into atmosphere safely. Detection of such gases on other planets may hint at alien life."
