        "article_body": "Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said Austria would retain its neutral status even as Sweden and Finland overhauled decades-long foreign policy stances to apply for NATO membership amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Schallenberg added that Austria, which obtains 80% of its natural gas from Russia, would continue to provide humanitarian support to Ukraine rather than lethal weapons."
