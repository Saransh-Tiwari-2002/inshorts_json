        "article_body": "Turkish Parliament has passed a new media bill that could see reporters and social media users jailed for up to three years for spreading \"disinformation\". The Council of Europe said the new measure's vague definition of \"disinformation\" and the accompanying threat of jail could have a \"chilling effect and increased self-censorship, not least in view of the upcoming elections in...2023\"."
